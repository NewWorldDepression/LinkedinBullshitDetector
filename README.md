LinkedIn Bullshit Detector 💩
Tired of drowning in LinkedIn posts filled with "disruptive synergies" and "holistic roadmaps" that make your eyes roll? 🙄 The LinkedIn Bullshit Detector is the Chrome extension you've been waiting for! ✨

This lightweight and discreet extension instantly analyzes the content of each post in your LinkedIn feed and assigns it a bullshit score out of 100. 💯

How It Works 🛠️
Our smart algorithm scans the text for:

Corporate Buzzwords & Jargon: 🗣️ Phrases designed to impress but often hide a lack of real substance.

Excessive Repetition: 🔁 Overuse of generic terms or ideas that don't add value.

Over-the-top Emoji Usage: 😂 While emojis can be fun, too many might signal "feel-good" content that's actually quite empty.

Vague & Hollow Phrases: 🤔 Generic statements that don't convey concrete information or action.

What You'll See 👀
Directly below each post, near the profile identity button, you'll spot a small, colored badge:

🟢 Green (Low Score): "Potentiel Bullshit: Faible" – This post seems clear, concise, and genuinely useful. Nice! 👍

🟠 Orange (Moderate Score): "Potentiel Bullshit: Modéré" – Tread carefully; there might be some corporate speak creeping in. Keep your BS radar up! 📡

🔴 Red (High Score): "Potentiel Bullshit: Élevé ! 🚩" – Warning! You're likely reading something full of hot air or overly inflated corporate jargon. Proceed with extreme skepticism. 🛑

Why Use It? 🤔
Save Time: ⏰ Quickly filter out the noise and focus on truly insightful or valuable content.

Sharpen Your Critical Eye: 🧐 Train yourself to spot common corporate communication patterns that might be designed to obscure rather than inform.

Improve Your Feed: ✨ Make your LinkedIn experience more efficient, less frustrating, and more engaging by highlighting posts that actually matter.

Install the LinkedIn Bullshit Detector and take back control of your feed! Your brain will thank you. 🧠
